\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of Neural Networks, that are able to incorporate spatial information of a 2-dimensional feature space. Therefore they are especially practicable for image recognition tasks. 
CNNs were introduced and examined by LeCun et. al. on handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset in the late 90s
\cite{LeCun1998}.
