\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}\label{sec:prev_nn_cnn}
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of neural networks, that are able to incorporate spatial information with convolutional filters.
Spatial information is very important in images where neighboring pixels are releated to each other and convolutional filters are very commonly used in image processing and therefore naturally understandable in its mechanics.
This is one reason why CNNs are so practicable for image recognition tasks and usually state of the art image recognition architectures have some kind of convolutional neural network implemented within.

CNNs were introduced and examined by LeCun et. al. on handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset in the late 90s
\cite{LeCun1998}.
With their restricted and highly spatial connections and weight sharing through convolutional filters, they are an valuable asset no researchers should miss when working with images or audio recognition.
