\section{Audio features}
The extraction of audio features from acoustic waveforms is important for data compression.
One of the most popular features are the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), developed by
\cite{Mermelstein1980} in 1980.
They are motivated by the physiological human hearing system.
