\subsection{Adversarial Neural Networks}\label{sec:prev_nn_adv}
Adversarial Neural Networks are motivated by Game Theory, in a way that they incorporate usually two separate networks, denoted as players, playing a game against each other.
The game hereby is to outperform the other player in a specific task.
The idea of creating generative networks emerged from Goodfellow in 2014 \cite{Goodfellow2014}, where one player (network) produces fake images, that are similar to real ones and the other player has to detect if it given image is a real or fake one.
Both players are therefore improving themselves upon each other, to either create more realistic fakes or to detect fakes from reals with low error rates.
