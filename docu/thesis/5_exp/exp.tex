\chapter{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}
All experiments hold within this thesis can be found in this chapter.
At the start it gives inside to the the Datasets and its feature extraction used for training the neural network architectures.
Some sound examples and their feature representation of the datasets are shown and the quality and diversity of recorded samples is mentioned.

More importantly this chapter includes the evaluation of the neural network models and their feature inputs in the application of speech command classification.
In Detail the feature selection is evaluated, to observe the impact of feature reduction.
Further the adversarial training approaches are compared to usual training.
Then the wavenet performances are shown...

% The training details are listed to give the reader an overview of the selected parameters for training, it should also give a shorten reference, so that not all parameters must be listed in the plots. 
% The training and evaluation consists of following evaluation tasks:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Feature Selection
%   \item Adversarial Training
% \end{enumerate}
