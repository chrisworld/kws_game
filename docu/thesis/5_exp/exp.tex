\chapter{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}
All experiments and their obtained results are presented in this chapter.
Before the experiments are demonstrated, the datasets and its feature extraction used for training the neural network architectures is described and analyzed.
Some sound examples and feature representation of the datasets are shown and the quality and diversity of the recorded samples is discussed.
More importantly this chapter includes the evaluation of the neural network models in Key Word Spotting (KWS) of speech commands.
In detail the feature selection of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is evaluated on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to observe the impact of feature reduction.
Adversarial pre-training of CNNs is compared to usual training.
Wavenet performances on raw speech signals are examined.
