\subsection{My own Dataset}\label{sec:exp_dataset_my}
The author of this thesis recorded some speech command samples by himself and used it as own test set in evaluating trained models in the machine learning part. No self recorded files are used within the training set, so that it can be shown that unseen voice characteristics are classified correctly.
All examples of my own dataset are illustrated in \rfig{exp_dataset_wav_grid_my} in raw audio format.
