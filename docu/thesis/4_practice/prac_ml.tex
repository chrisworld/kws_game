\section{Machine Learning Evaluation}\label{sec:ml}
In this section, the machine learning evaluation of the mentioned Neural Network Architectures, denoted here also simply as models, are presented.
The training details are listed to give the reader an overview of the selected parameters for training, it should also give a shorten reference, so that not all parameters must be listed in the plots. 
The training and evaluation consists of following evaluation tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Feature Selection
  \item Adversarial Training
\end{enumerate}
