\subsection{Feature Selection}
Now that the Neural Network Architectures are described in \rsec{nn_arch} and basic knowledge about MFCCs is given in \rsec{features} it is important to evaluate the impact of the selection of certain MFCC feature constellations to the accuracy of the Test sets.
In detail it is shown how a fixed model is trained with features consisting of following MFCC parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cepstral Coefficients (usual MFCCs)
    \item Deltas (frame difference of MFCCs)
    \item Double Deltas (frame difference of Deltas)
    \item Energy Vector (added to each of the upper features)
\end{enumerate}
Another crucial point is to evaluate whether a frame based normalization of these features hurt the training and the accuracy of the models.
