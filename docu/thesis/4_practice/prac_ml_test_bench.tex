\subsection{Test Bench of best Neural Network Architectures}
This section compares the best Neural Network Architectures in terms of noise and shift invariance to fixed test wave files.
The test wave files are recorded by the author and its length is cut, so that by using a the fixed input frames of 500ms, both end positions consists at least of half of the wave file information.
Only the L5 labels were used.

\subsubsection{Shift invariances}
Shift invariances is very important for audio classification, e.g. the waveform should be still classified the same when shifted a little bit in time.
However the restricted frame size of 500ms makes this task very difficult, as it is already known that not all information can fit in there, e.g. like the \enquote{t} in \enquote{left} or \enquote{right} is often missed.

\subsection{Noise invariances}
Also noise invariance in classification of audio data is very important. 
This is because bad microphones or a bad recording set ups can yield a lot of noise in the audio data.
