\chapter{Practice}
The practical part of this thesis can be found in this chapter.
It gives information about the Datasets and feature extraction of its data used for training the Neural Network architectures.
The dataset details and properties of the sound files are presented.
Some sound examples and their feature representation of the datasets are shown and the quality and diversity of recorded samples is mentioned.

Also this chapter includes the evaluation of the Neural Network models and the evolution process of the individual approaches used for speech command classification.
Also the implementation of the Key Word Spotting system and some Game Design ideas of possible applications with speech commands are given.
