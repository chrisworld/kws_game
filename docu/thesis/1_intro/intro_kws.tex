\section{The task of Key Word Spotting}\label{sec:intro_kws}
As described earlier Key Word Spotting (KWS) is the task of classifying a spoken word as key word out of a set of key words.
The set of key words or vocabulary is denoted as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_kws_dict}
	S \coloneqq \{s_i, \quad i=1 \dots n\}
\end{equation}
with a total number of $n$ key words denoted individually as $s_i$.
