\section{Visual Guidance}
To get a better overview on the presentation of data and results, context specific color color-schemes are used within this thesis.
% There exist following context abstractions:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item raw waveforms from soundfiles
%     \item extracted features, e.g. MFCCs
%     \item weights matrices of neural network models
%     \item training scores
% \end{itemize}
