\section{Overview of this thesis and special notations}\label{intro_overview}

This thesis is organized such, that each chapter leads to the next one and someone who is interested in creating her own KWS game can
follow it as some guidance.
After the introduction, \rsec{prev} is about previous and related work.
Some history about Neural Networks is given, as well as works that influenced this thesis.
Some works are used as motivation and some to get an idea.
Others provide benchmarks on the speech commands dataset or describe Neural Networks Models that perform well on speech.
In any way it is important to know, what is happening in the field of KWS and in which direction research is heading towards.

\subsection{Visual Guidance}
To get a better overview on the presentation of data and results, context specific color color-schemes are used within this thesis.
% There exist following context abstractions:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item raw waveforms from soundfiles
%     \item extracted features, e.g. MFCCs
%     \item weights matrices of neural network models
%     \item training scores
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{International Phonetic Alphabet}
The International Phonetic Alphabet is, as it name suggest, an alphabet of phonetics, where phonetics can be defined as human speaking sounds.
A word formed with letters from a real Alphabet might trick the speaker of this word on how to pronounce it correctly, but described with the IPA, there is no misconception.
In some sections within this thesis, there are plots with phonetic transcriptions containing IPA characters, some special ones are described in \rtab{intro_overview_ipa}.
