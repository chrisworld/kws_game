\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Key Word Spotting (KWS) is the task of identifying or classifying spoken words from human speakers out of a limited vocabulary or set of key words. 
For example it is the task of identify the spoken word \enquote{left} out of the vocabulary \{\enquote{left}, \enquote{right}\}. 
This problem is solved by humans everyday with not much effort, but it is a real challenge for computer systems.

The task of KWS is not a new one, it is solved with a variety of different approaches.
One approach to solve it on a computer system, is to use the advances in Machine Learning, or more specifically in this thesis, the advances in Neural Networks.

KWS systems are since long ago no science-fiction anymore. 
There already exists many real world applications for consumers in everyday situations.
Slowly Key Word Spotting, or generally speaking speech recognition, become accepted and widely used in the society of human beings.
%(e.g. \textit{Alexa} from the company \textit{Amazon}).

Also video games are a potential application to KWS, for instance to control some elements within the game.
Until now there not that many game out there with the ability to be controlled by their players voice. 
It is the aim to get some light into the shadows of the reasons, why it did not become more popular.


In summary, the focus of this thesis lies on Key Word Spotting with Neural Networks in supervised learning on a Speech Command Dataset \cite{Warden2018}.
Further the best suitable solutions of speech commands classification for video games should be presented and evaluated.

%However unfortunately due to the (usually) large amount of data and complex Neural Network Architectures it is in most cases not tractable, how these systems learn to distinguish between different samples. Nevertheless the technical benefits and their performance made them a standard tool in modern Machine Learning tasks.
