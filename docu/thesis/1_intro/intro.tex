\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Key Word Spotting (KWS) is the recognition task of spoken words by human speakers, with regard to a limited set of key words or simply called vocabulary.
The limited set of key words is crucial to restrict the complexity of the recognition task, because in most applications it is not necessary to cover all words existing a national language.
If a vocabulary would be to large, KWS might not be the best approach for finding a solution and it is recommended to explore other ideas such as phoneme recognition and probabilistic models of word occurrences.

To illustrate KWS consider the task of identifying the spoken word \enquote{left} out of the vocabulary \{\enquote{left}, \enquote{right}\}.
The vocabulary in this case, contains only two key words and is not really difficult to solve this problem with computer systems.

However if the amount of key words increases and the problem extends to generalize different speaker characteristics, such as nationality, age or gender, it becomes significantly more difficulty to solve and reduce word to word confusions.

Remarkably Humans are able to solve such problems in a flicker of time and with almost no cognitive effort, but it is a real challenge for machine learning systems such as neural networks.

Nowadays KWS systems are considered no science-fiction anymore, assisting consumers in everyday situations, such as rendering simple control tasks like the triggering of a photo release button on a \emph{smartphone} with a single speech command.
Application like this create more awareness of Key Word Spotting, or generally speaking speech recognition tasks, in human society.
The few examples that are really applied by users are just the peak of the iceberg of numerous other applications that might follow in future.

Unfortunately some consumer applications with speech recognition created by some renowned big companies, leave some bitter aftertastes in data privacy issues through an externally computational inefficient processing pipeline over their servers \cite{Tang2018}.
It is therefore important to distance speech recognition from meaningless data collection and wast of energy and enhance its value in society.

One idea to get a better image on KWS is to create video games with it.
Until now there exist very few video games with the special feature of using players voices to control some elements within a video game.
Reasons for that may depends on the history of video games itself, where players are in a fast paced arcade game and speech recognition is simply to slow, or that the complexity of KWS and lack of training data is a reasonable fact for not deploying such games.

The following section in this introduction will explain further details about the individuall domains necessary for a KWS video game. 
Further the research questions are listed and an overview is given.

In summary, the focus of this thesis lies on key word spotting with neural networks in supervised learning trained on a speech command dataset \cite{Warden2018}.
The best suitable solutions of speech commands classification for video games are presented and evaluated with special interests in convolutional neural networks, adversarial neural networks and wavenets.
