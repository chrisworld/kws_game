\chapter{Introduction}
Key Word Spotting is the task of identifying spoken words from human speakers out of a limited vocabulary or set of Key Words, e.g. identify the word \enquote{left} out of the vocabulary \{\enquote{left}, \enquote{right}\}. This problem is easily solved by humans in everyday live, but it is a real challenge for computer systems on which we aim to tackle it.

One approach to solve Key Word Spotting on a computer system is to use the advances of Machine Learning. which enables the computer to automatically learn abstract representations of the data given as input. 
The output of a Machine Learning system is...
and to infer an appropriate output, e.g. the waveform of \enquote{left} stored as \textit{.mp4} file is

Nowadays there are already many existing applications in the real world accessible for consumers and therefore slowly accepted in our society.
%(e.g. \textit{Alexa} from the company \textit{Amazon}).

The task of Key Word Spotting is not a new one, it is solved with a variety of different approaches. 
One approach commonly used, is a Machine Learning system composed of a Neural Networks.
The big advantage of Neural Networks is that they can cope with a huge amount of input features and are able to extract their own sub features through many layers within the network.

This means that they learn their own feature representations, selection and interpretation, rather than using hand-crafted ones done by humans with expertise in the application. 
What sounds great at first hand, is also a bit of a downfall, since everyone who is able to use Machine Learning tools, can create a solution to a rather complex problem usually done by experts, given they have enough data and processing power available.
This yield into less understanding of the actual problem and \enquote{try and error} approaches, since Neural Networks just need to be feed with the right data and parameters for training.
However it is not always this way, it is extremely interesting how and why Neural Networks are able to produce such good results. 
This feedbacks again experts to gain more understanding or a different viewpoint on the problem.

%However unfortunately due to the (usually) large amount of data and complex Neural Network Architectures it is in most cases not tractable, how these systems learn to distinguish between different samples. Nevertheless the technical benefits and their performance made them a standard tool in modern Machine Learning tasks.
