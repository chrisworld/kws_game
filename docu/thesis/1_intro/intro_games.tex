\section{Video Games with Speech Input}
A Speech Input for Video Games is a spoken waveform, recorded through a microphone, from any speaker intending to inflict a certain change while playing a Video Game. Certainly this spoken waveform has to be processed, such as other inputs channels have to be (like keyboard buttons pressed), so that its meaning can be understood by the computer system behind the game. Although this processing of a waveform is much more complicated and prone to errors, compared to a simple click on the keyboard or mouse. That might be one of the reasons why Speech Inputs are very rare to be found in Video Games, still they exist.
