\section{Problem Formulation for this Thesis}
In this section, several research question regarding Key Word Spotting in Video Games are asked and described in their interpretation.
The problem formulation for this thesis can be split into to 3 parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label={Q.\arabic*)}, leftmargin=1.4cm]
    \item Signal Processing and Feature Extraction of Speech Input.
    \item Neural Network Training and Classification of Speech Commands.
    \item Creating a Game were Speech Commands enhance the game experience.
\end{enumerate}
Note that a Key Word has the same meaning as a Speech Command in this thesis and therefore might be referred in either way.
Further note that not all research questions can be answered within the scope of this thesis in satisfactory way.
Nevertheless those questions can be asked and some solution concepts discussed.
