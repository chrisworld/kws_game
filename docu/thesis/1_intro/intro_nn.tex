\section{Neural Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition}
Neural Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition must be discussed in a separate section, because there many different solution concepts for Key Word Spotting tasks and Neural Networks are just a subset of this solutions, yet a very powerful and modern one. Also there exist a large variety of different Neural Network architectures to tackle the problem. However there are constraints to each applications and for Video Games
