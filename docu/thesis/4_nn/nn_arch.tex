\section{Neural Network Architectures}\label{sec:nn_arch}
All Neural Network Architectures evaluated within this thesis are presented here.
%There will be a general classification between Neural Network Architectures by Convolutional Neural Networks, Adversarial Neural Networks ...
In general the architectures can be differentiated between:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Convolutional Neural Networks
	\item Adversarial Neural Networks
	\item Wavenets
\end{enumerate}
The term Convolutional Neural Networks here consists of all architectures consisting of at least one convolutional layer and the intention to simply classify each speech commands from each other. 
Therefore the output of a Convolutional net is of size of the amount of speech commands and usually has some kind of probability distribution or energy equivalence.

With Adversarial Neural Networks all architectures are meant, with at least two separate Neural Network Architectures, e.g. a Discriminator and a Generator Network and the intention to outperform the other Network in a task where both play a game against each other.
The word game here, is used in the sense of Game Theory, where the goal is to find an equilibrium state where both players are equally satisfied with the state.

An overview of all models is shown in \rtab{nn_arch_overview} with abbreviations in \rtab{nn_arch_abbreviation}.
