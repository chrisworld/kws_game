\chapter{Neural Networks}\label{sec:nn}
This chapter contains the theoretical foundations of developing a Key Word Spotting system with Neural Networks for Video Games. 
In particular the signal processing and feature extraction is explained and visualized with many examples.
The same holds fo the machine learning part were central concepts of applied methods are discussed and shown.
At last it is important and has to be considered when building a video game with speech command inputs.
