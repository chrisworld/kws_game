\chapter{Neural Networks}\label{sec:nn}
%This chapter contains theoretical foundations and practical evaluation of developing a Key Word Spotting (KWS) system with neural networks, especially intended for video games
This chapter contains theoretical foundations and details about the used neural networks architectures applied to Key Word Spotting (KWS) of speech commands.
The training of the used neural networks and some special concepts, such as adversarial pre-training, are presented and experimental results shown.
Special focus is lied on energy efficiency and therefore each networks energy footprint is evaluated.
