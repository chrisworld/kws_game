%This chapter contains theoretical foundations and practical evaluation of developing a Key Word Spotting (KWS) system with neural networks, especially intended for video games
This chapter contains theoretical foundations and practical results regarding neural networks applied to the key word spotting in classifying speech commands.
The used architectures within this thesis are shown and explained in detail.
The training of those networks and some special concepts, such as adversarial pre-training, are presented.
Special focus is lied on energy efficiences, because key word spotting requires it in many practical applications, such as well as video games.
