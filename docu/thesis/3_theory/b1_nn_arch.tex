\subsection{Neural Network Architectures}\label{sec:nn_arch}
All Neural Network Architectures evaluated within this thesis are presented here.
There will be a general classification between Neural Network Architectures by Convolutional Neural Networks, Adversarial Neural Networks ...
The classification of Convolutional Neural Networks are all Architectures consisting of at least one convolutional layer and the intention to simply classify the speech commands.
As Adversarial Neural Networks we consider Architectures with at least two separate Neural Network Architectures, e.g. a Discriminator and a Generator Network, with the intention to outperform the other Network in a task where they both play a game against each other.
The word game here, is used in the sense of Game Theory, where the goal is to find an equilibrium state where both players are equally satisfied with the state.
