\chapter{Theory}
This chapter contains the theoretical foundations necessary to understand parts of this thesis. 
The signal processing and neural network preliminaries will be explained.
Further the problem formulations will be represented in a mathematical viewpoint.

%The problems will be described in a mathematical way and each solution concept explained so that it can be understood.
