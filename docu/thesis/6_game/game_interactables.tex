\section{Game Interactables}
\thesisStateNotReady
In this section the game interactables, denoted as all game objects which a player can interact with, are presented.

\subsection{Menu}
The game menu is the first that appears, when starting a video game. 
It usually contains settings for graphic and music.
With speech input, one setting is added, the setting of the recording device.
The available microphone input sources should be selectable and a small visualization bar of the input signals energy shall be placed, so that the user can verify the correct functionality of the device.
Further an option for the energy threshold, by which the device captures a speech input, must be adjustable, because of different output values from varying microphones.
