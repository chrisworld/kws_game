\chapter{Signal Processing and Feature Extraction}\label{sec:signal}
This section describes how raw waveforms from audio files are processed and meaningful features for speech recognition extracted.
The feature extraction compresses and reduces the dimensionality of input data and therefore computational effort for neural networks.
In this thesis, either raw audio samples are used directly as features, intended for Wavenets, or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) neural network architectures.
MFCC features are described in detail as well as enhancements of the same with deltas and a suitable visual representation.
