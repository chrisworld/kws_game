\chapter{Signal Processing and Feature Extraction}\label{sec:signal}
This section describes how raw waveforms from audio files are processed and in which way it is possible to extract meaningful features from them.
Also it is discussed how to get to those meaningful features and how they can be compressed to reduce dimensionality and therefore computational effort for Neural Networks.
At last it is shown what further possibilities there are to enhance feature or create a better visual representation for them, this specializes merely on MFCCs.
