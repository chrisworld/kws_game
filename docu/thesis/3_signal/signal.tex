\chapter{Signal Processing and Feature Extraction}\label{sec:signal}
This section describes how to process raw waveforms from audio files to extract meaningful features from them.
Further it is mentioned, how the features are compressed to reduce dimensionality and therefore computational effort for Neural Networks.
In this thesis, either raw audio samples are used directly as features, intended for wavenets, or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features for all other more classifcal Neural Network Architectures.
At last it is shown what further possibilities exist to enhance MFCC features and create a better visual presentation for them.
